# GrindForLevels_WeeklyGameJam6
This small game was created in one week for a weekly game jam

The theme of the event was "Obey!" with entrants free to interpret that however they like. I chose to create a small-scale turn based strategy RPG, where the units could not be controlled directly, but could instead be given vague orders. Maps are very small in scale -- 5 squares by 5 squares. But features such as leveling up, enemy AI, and path finding have been implemented.

This was developed in C++ using the Allegro library.
